# Phishing_Detection_using_SVM
This project aims to detect phishing websites using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The model is trained on a phishing dataset from Kaggle, which contains various features extracted from legitimate and phishing URLs. The goal is to classify whether a given website is phishing (malicious) or legitimate (safe) based on URL characteristics.
